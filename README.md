# SDK

The Cerebellum SDK is a powerful library that simplifies realtime communication in web applications. Built as an abstraction over socket.io, it provides enhanced capabilities for message handling, presence management, and channel-based communication. Key features include:

- Easy WebSocket connection management
- Secure authentication flows
- Channel-based messaging
- Presence management for user status tracking
- Historical message retrieval
- Full TypeScript support
- Ready-to-use React hooks for streamlined development

This SDK is designed to help developers quickly implement robust realtime features in their applications without dealing with the complexities of WebSocket management and realtime data synchronization. Built to integrate seamlessly with popular JavaScript frameworks like React, it provides a simple and intuitive API for building realtime applications.

Once you have built your application and are ready to deploy it in production, check out the Cerebellum [cli](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Realtime/cli) to easily deploy the infrastructure needed to horizontally scale your application. All without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.
